Forces refresh from server, not cache.
A better solution might be to break each show's entry in the search_results page
into a partial and then update just the relevant button directly. Don't think I
can / should update the ruby instance variable @user_tv_show_tmdb_ids directly
from here. Besides, the view would likely still need to be refreshed.
