# TVQueue

TV Queue provides a way to keep track of all of the shows you're watching, across all networks and streaming services.  

## How it works

### First login

Once you have registered and logged in, you will be greeted with a nice, fresh, empty screen. This is your Queue. Click on the 'Manage Shows' link at the top right.

### Managing Shows

#### Adding a show

Click 'Manage Shows'. The link is in the upper right corner of the interface, on the navigation bar.

Enter the name of a TV Show in the search bar and click 'Go'.  
From the list of results being displayed, click the 'Queue' button next to the appropriate entry. Click 'Resend' when prompted by your browser to update the page.

#### Removing a show

Click 'Manage Shows'. The link is in the upper right corner of the interface, on the navigation bar.

Enter the name of a TV Show already in your queue in the search bar and click 'Go'. From the list of results being shown, click the 'Remove' button next to the entry for the show you are trying to delete from your queue. Click 'Resend' when prompted by your browser to update the page.

#### Marking shows as 'already viewed'

##### One at a time

Once you have some shows in your queue, click on the 'Queue' link in the upper right hand corner (on the navigation bar). To the right of each episode's entry is a blue box. Once you have viewed an episode (or decided to skip it, I don't judge) click on the box. The episode will be checked off of your list.  

##### A lot at once

If you are already halfway through season 5 of a show and don't feel like clicking 80 boxes, click again on the 'Manage Shows' link. Search for the show as above. Once you have identified it in the results page, you can type the season number and episode number of the most recently broadcast episode you have already viewed. Click 'Mark'. This process can take a few seconds, so be patient and you will be redirected once again to your queue.

### Your Queue

Your queue will be made up of a list of episodes. When it loads it will automatically scroll to the oldest episode you have not yet watched. Episodes you have already viewed will remain at the bottom of your list. You can tell that you have already marked them as viewed either by observing the small checkmark in the blue box (See the section on marking shows as 'already viewed' above) on the right, or by it's white background. The first episode chronologically which you have not yet watched will have a blue background. Future episodes that air no later than today will be green. Any episodes that have been announced and don't air until a future date will be displayed at the top of the list (scroll up to see them) with a yellow background.
